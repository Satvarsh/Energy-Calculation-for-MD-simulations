# Energy-Calculation-for-MD-simulations

Made this as my university project for Parallel and Distributed Computing Course

- UsesOpen-MPat its core to showcase the power of Parallel Processing <br>
- Consists of Literature Review along with Performance Pro-filer <br>
- Includes FOUR versions of code that uses varied range of parallel functions <br>
- Reduced wall time by >50%in ALL the test cases <br>

## Contents

- Report (Test Reports + Video DEMO and more) <br>
- Code<br>

Note : Some parallel functions which I am used in my code are <br> 

- pragma omp parallel<br> 
- pragma omp reduction <br>
- pragma omp for<br>
- pragma omp shared<br>
- pragma omp private<br>
